# Theme Rebuilder (CM)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicholaschum/ThemeEngineRebuilder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholaschum/RebuildThemeEngine)

Theme Rebuilder is a CyanogenMod Theme Engine modification utility to clear out resource-cache theme files to allow your themes to be rebuilt on the next reboot. The app mainly shows one dialog and allows you to press Proceed to let the application run. Once the app runs, a notification will pop up informing the user to "Press here to reboot". If the app does not detect root, then it would not launch and a notification would tell the user that root is required to run the app.
